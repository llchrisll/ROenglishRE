The conversation with Echinacea was a rather one-sided talk. You have been assigned to be Mr. Kidd's assistant so you better go speak to him.#
Mr. Kidd#

7013#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
...You have expressed that you're not comfortable with doing chores and Mr. Kidd tells you to be clear with Echinacea that you don't want the task.#
Echinacea#

7014#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
...Well, it was still impossible to win Echinacea over. You should just go back and help Mr. Kidd no matter what.#
Mr. Kidd#

7015#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Mr. Kidd's request was simpler than you thought. At Southwest Morocc, you must meet Rin at the underground tavern.#
Rin#

7016#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You must investigate the region where Rin was ambushed. The area is somewhere west of Abyss Lake and south of the second hill from the top of the mountain...#

#

7020#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
All of a sudden, you started to feel furious and couldn't stop the urge to beat up those enemies.#
Stop all the Dandelions#

7021#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You have found a Sealed Magic Scroll from one of the of a Dandelion Gang's bodies. It must be something important so you should bring it to Mr. Kidd.#
Report to Mr. Kidd#

7022#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You need to investigate the magic spell scroll. Echinacea knows which scholar to consult about it.#
Echinacea#

7023#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Echinacea has introduced a scholar named 'Defaria' but where is he? Is he the one baking sweet potatoes?#
Speak to Defaria#

7024#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The old scholar Defaria requested for some materials to unseal the scroll.#

7025#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You need to get all the required materials. Defaria said, 'I’ll be waiting for your return.'#

7026#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The scroll is unsealed. Such scrolls are generally used by ^4d4dfforganizations to gather their members^000000. He says you should use it now but it's a question whether you should talk to Mr. Kidd first.#
#

7027#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You heard some suspicious story while investigating the building where you arrived by using the scroll. You heard that the Dandelions are fighting each other..#
Report to Mr. Kidd#

7028#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You told Mr. Kidd what you've heard from the basement in the empty house near the national border. There will be a serious internal dispute and it'd be the perfect time to raid them.#

Echinacea is analyzing the pattern number to detect the magic wavelength strength. This could lead us to Rayan and maybe even Satan Morocc...#
#

7035#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Go to the building with a mana detector attached to it at the south of this camp and ask about the trace results.#
#

7036#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The trace failed but the Manager says that since the stone is still intact that Rayan must still be alive somewhere. Report to Echinacea and ask her if she has any ideas on tracing Rayan Moore.#
Report to Echinacea#

7037#Case closed?#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The case is closed now, but what is this thing that still lingers in your head? You should ask somebody about the Dandelion request because Echinacea isn't being too helpful.#
#

You questioned Defaria over and over again and he seemed to start talking about Dandelion. But, he changed the subject again and asked you to deliver some sweet potatoes to Mr. Kidd.#

At the Laphine's post, 'Splendide,' you met a Laphine, 'Arc' who asked you to find his friend, 'Terra.' He says Terra usually leaves traces by tying plants into knots.#

7058#Messenger - Arc's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You fell between giant roots of a tree. You've found a giant tribe called the 'Sapha,' hard as rocks and big as mountain. Seems like there's no more traces left from Terra.#
Report to Arch#

7059#Messenger - Terra's Whereabouts#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Arc's worried that Terra went off with Bradium from the Lab without permission. Terra could have gone to the 'Sapha' in that 'Cave' with a Bradium.#
Find Terra#

7060#Messenger - Terra's Whereabouts#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
When you arrived to see the Sapha, Terra was already long gone. Very bright pieces of mineral were scattered around the hardened giant. These pieces must be the Bradium.#
If Bradium is related.. would it be the Sapha?#

7061#Messenger - Terra's Whereabouts#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
In the town of the 'Sapha,' you overheard something about a captured 'Laphine'.#
You must find the captured Laphine.#

7062#Messenger - Terra's Whereabouts#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You heard that the Laphine captured in Manuk is injured. Maybe you'll be able to see her if you get some remedy.#
Ask Arc#

7063#Messenger - Terra's Whereabouts#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found out that 'Yggdrasil berry' is the best remedy for the Raffine. You should collect some Yggdrasil berries around the gigantic tree.#
Collect at least 6 Yggdrasil berries#

7064#Messenger - Terra's Whereabouts#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

Snorren suspects that the hardened Sapha might be his friend, 'Ogen' and requests to see the evidence.#
Go back to the cave and find some evidence#

7067#Messenger - Prove the Truth#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've got some 'Bradium fragments' from the hardened body of the Sapha and a 'Shabby Muffler.' These should be enough evidence!#
Show the evidence to Luik and Snorren#

7068#Messenger - Prove the Truth#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Looks like the 'Shabby Muffler' is the one from a friend of Snorren's. It was also proved that Terra was really trying to save 'Ogen' with 'Bradium's fragments'.#
Go to Ogen before it's too late#

7069#Messenger - Too late!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Looks like you're too late to save Ogen. Snorren turned his back and started to walk back to the town. You should pick up Terra.#
#

7070#Messenger - Terra's Return#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You heard from Snorren that Terra has been released.#

7417#Kardui's request#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Mayor Jun did not listen to my sincere stories, but instead stated that he would listen to more of it if I were to contribute to Eclage more significantly. Let's take care of the Laphines in Eclage that need help.#

Receiving the gift through Shenime.#

7423#A rumor about the King 1#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
During the conversation with Leo, unsettling things about Kardui were told. He didn't seem to get into the details but it was very concerning.#
#

7424#A rumor about the King 2#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Fome shared something unexpected. It was that Laphines have been subtly disliking Kardui. This was similar to what Leo seemed to keep to himself before.#
#

7425#A rumor about the King 3#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Connection between Cenes's despotism and Kardui was made through talking with the Laphines. It is not too serious, but it is certain that the current king Kardui is being considered in a way similar to how Cenes was.#
#

7426#A rumor about the King 4#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Most recently, Kardui seemed to have become Mayor Jun in the midst of the calamity facing the entire Laphine race. They don't seem to completely disagree with his policies, but they don't seem to agree with them either.#
#

7427#At times like this, face it straight on!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The truth behind Laphine's anxiety and fear toward Kardui could no longer be elucidated. Shouldn't this at least be communicated to the individual of interest? It might be possible to hear about the reason behind it all..#

In Kardui's letter, there was not only an introduction but also a request to look for his father, Avant the Scholar of Magics. Help Hisie to find out more about the scholar from within Eclage.#
#

7437#Shenime's favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Could not obtain Avant's info but instead got a strange request from Shenime. Asked to gather experimental ingredients for the scholar of magics he sponsors. They are 10 Dust Balls, 10 Leaf Bookmarks.#
10 Dust Balls, 10 Leaf Bookmarks.#

7438#Secret sponsorship#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

Hisie stated that if you track down Shenime, the location of the scholar might be identified as well. Find out Shenime's duties.#

7441#Mail is here!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Planned to visit the scholar of magic's Yai as if Shenime is sending a mail. Hisie will confirm whether that person is Avant. Hisie will provide the information at the crossroads in front of Eclage.#

7442#The identity of the scholar of magics#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The scholar of magics found through the strategy was indeed Avant. Must tell this to Kardui.#
Talk with Kardui.#

7443#Interfere with the research!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
A small revenge. Kardui and Hisie want to know what Avant is researching and want to interfere it. Could this be a small revenge of the brothers?#
Interfereing Avant's research.#

7444#What Avant was researching#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Avant was researching on the methods to extract the Orb's magic power. Since this is dangerous information, the research materials should immediately be returned to Kardui.#
Deliver the research materials to Kardui.#

//--Orb 

7445#Avant's back#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Researched the force behind Avant's research on the Orb. The most likely culpril is Avant's sponsor, the chief of staff. Approach the chief of staff to reveal the truth.#
Talk with the chief of staff.#

7446#Unfruitful conversation#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Talked with Shenime the chief of staff, but nothing was gained. He states that he might also have been tricked by Avant. The chief of staff was actually upset that Kardui only increased the defenses surrounding the Orb.#
Report to Kardui.#

7447#Dilemma surrounding the Orb#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Only confirmed the distrust toward Kardui's instead of revealing more about Avant's research. The chief of staff hoped that Kardui's judgment has not weakened, and asked that he would demonstrate it.#
Report to Kardui.#

7448#Something's not right#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
After discussing with Kardui and Hisie, it is decided that the chief of staff is indeed the most suspicious. What is the reason behind his resistance toward Kardui's actions toward the Orb?#
Surveillance of the chief of staff.#

7449#Temptation toward the Orb#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The chief of staff asked to go to the Orb's lighting room to discuss it. I decided to let Kardui know about this after telling him to give me some time to think about it.#
Report to Kardui.#

7450#Orb's lighting room#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Not sure why the chief of staff kept trying to lure me into the Orb's lighting room, but decided to go there even just to figure out why. Let's go along with what he wants for now.#
Hold hands with the chief of staff.#

7451#Betrayal#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Everything is so confusing. The monster battled in the lighting room was not a subordinate of the King of Demons. They controlled me without my knowledge. Shenime the chief of staff betrayed all!#
Report to Kardui.#

7452#Find the chief of staff!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Shenime the chief of staff, who was responsible for all these occurrences, has hidden his whereabouts. According to Hisie's sources, residual magic force was faintly felt in Bifrost.#
Survey Northern Bifrost.#

7453#The last of the chief of staff#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The road from the north to the south in Bifrost. It used to be an open path but is currently blocked by a huge rift in the south. On the way to the rift, the chief of staff's corpse was found.#

#

You found the 2nd control panel and it is completely broken. Report this back to Zelmeto.#
#

8019#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto asked you to inspect the automatic pressure governors and to report any problems no matter how small they may seem.#
#

8020#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found the automatic pressure governors and after checking more carefully, you find that it's making strange grinding noises and a few of the surface screws are loose. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8021#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now Zelmeto asked you to inspect another control panel. It's similar to the first one but bigger. It's located in the middle of the factory. Find it and report back to Zelmeto.#
#

8022#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The main control panel doesn't look like it has any problems. But after tapping on its surface, you hear a disheartening hollow sound. It looks like it's missing some parts... Report your findings to Zelmeto.#

Now you must inspect a pipe located near the large cauldrons of molten metal and report your findings to Zelmeto.#

Find a foreigner in town.#

8108#A Foreigner, Katinshuell#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

11172#Request from Frede#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
All my friends must be in the cave since I saw them coming to replenish Bradium. Hope them to stay healthy. Would you visit them to check if they are fine?#
Meet Friends of Frede, Brian, John, Tyler, Rose, Bain, and Lash.#

11173#Request from Frede#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I'm really sorry that I'm asking for your favour continuously, but would you deliver Bradium to my friends? If you ask Bouy at the building located northwest of the village, he will give you some refined Bradium. Please do get it.#
Meet Bouy and get refined Bradium.#

11174#Supply Shortage#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
It takes a lot of time to refine a large Bradium mineral but small pieces of Bradium will be quick. You can easily collect pieces of Bradium from monsters nearby. About 30 pieces of Bradium will be enough to share with 6 people.#
There is not enough Bradium. Collect 30 small pieces of Bradium.#

11175#Supply Shortage#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Handwork is much faster to refine pieces of Bradium instead of using a machine. I will only need an hour to finish. Please go rest while I get to work.#
The job seems to need 2 hours to be done.#

11176#For my friends#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Work completed! Bouy was a bit nervous because it had been a long time since he did manual work but he did a good job. Please take these to friends.#
Give the refined Bradium to friends and go back to Frede to tell the story.#

60721#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I should let Rebarev Doug know I'm ABOUT TO LEAVE, oh but first I should make sure I find out more about the FINAL MISSION.#

#

60723#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ask Librarian Jekan if he has found the 1st squad's final mission's paper work. He has bad eyesight and is in need of a Magnifier and a Lantern.#
#

60724#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Librarian Jekan looks to be busy, perhaps I should just 'read some documents' for awhile and then check on the shelves for until he figures out where I should check on the shelves for 'The 3rd Platoon Records'.#
#

60725#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jekan will need a few items to make a copy of the records. 2 Slick Paper and 1 Oil Paper from Amatsu, 3 Feather of Birds from Morocc, and 20 Blue Gems from Geffen.#
Bring these items to Jekan to make him finish the copy faster.#

60726#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Your copy of the records has a weird search magic on it. To find specific info, you need to first check for broad topic then get more specific: crusader 3rd_company 3rd_platoon 1st_squad.#
Look up the individual members names to find out where they are nowadays.#

60727#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Find Zan Huadoku inside the Geffen Blacksmith guild. Observe politeness when asking him how he is doing before jumping in to ask about their top secret final mission. Yeah, that's the ticket!#
#

60728#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zan Huadoku has told you all that you think is possible. You should head to Morocc to find 'Cuaque Donon' who was last seen at the Inn. You have a feeling that you may need to be stubborn in Morocc.#
#

60729#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cuaque Donon is in a Rogue Guild hideout probably at 'Fortress Saint Darmain (South)' (use map ctrl + ~) The password to enter should be 'Aragham never hoarded upgrade items'.#
Cuaque is suffering from extreme PTSD and 'freaks out' so pretending he is a young child would help, maybe even a dolly hahaha.#

60730#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cuaque said the squad found the 'Megingjard' and an argument broke out... You need to know more about that argument, perhaps Jack.O in Alberta on the docks can help.#
He is still an active crusader, so I think talking to him will be much more straight forward.#

60731#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jack.O found some relief from 'Green Herb's. Perhaps I should pass that advice onto the other Crusaders I meet. Emma Searth is in Aldebaran, a quick boat to Izlude and a Kafra warp to Aldebaran will have me there in a jiffy!#
Maybe I should also contemplate a memory aid for these crusaders, something to help them remember their place like a 'Bookclip' from a 'Rideword'#

60732#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I think I need to hurry to see 'The Nineball' he works as a bouncer in the Jawaii inn. I heard there is an ex-barkeep of Jawaii working in the Central Prontera Pub maybe he knows a way to get to Jawaii without tying the knot!#
Someone named Nineball and who is a bouncer probably is pretty closed mouth kinda guy, I should keep talking until he at least reacts to my questions...#

60733#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Exit Jawaii with a Butterflywing or drink yourself back to Rune-Midgarts. Get to Comodo to see 'Royal Myst' at the south casino. Morocc to Comodo is usually the easiest way to warp to Comodo.#
A 'couple' of shots of 'Alcohol' can loosen Royal Myst's tongue...#

60734#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've spoken to all the crusaders that are still alive, apparently something happened, blame was passed and Crusader Egnigem died in the process. You should return to Prontera Castle and inform him of your findings.#
A kafra hop from Comodo to Morocc to Prontera is quick unless you're saved in Prontera.#

60735#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You should talk to the last member of the 1st squad, the late Egnigem. A Kafra hop from Prontera to Morocc to Comodo then to Umbala and then a journey north to the Tree of Life to Nifflheim can get you to him.#
Listen to Egnigem and see what you can do to fix this.#

60736#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
By Odin's mercy this is terrible, you never believed that a holy Crusader would do such an evil act to claim the power of Megingjard. Be brave and return to the Crusader Headquarters and tell Max Von Shedough what you know.#
#

60737#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Max Von Shedough has accepted my report, and is deeply troubled by its contents, but part of me truly believes that despite good intentions the political reality may intervene to keep justice from being had.#
I must tell Egnigem at least of the outcome, he deserves at least to know what he died for..#

60738#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Egnigem has blessed you with all his remaining strength. You have a feeling that there is one special someone that he would want to know his fate, You must tell Emma Searth about his fate.#
#

60739#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Emma can't Remember, but she can feel the loss. Your faith in Justice is weak now... You must tell Max Von Shedough he is the Judge and he should share this burden of guilt.#
Return to Max Von Shedough at Prontera Castle.#
